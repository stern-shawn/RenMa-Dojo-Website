# RenMa Dojo Website
Personal project to design a cleaner, responsive, and more SEO-friendly website for my Kendo dojo.

## Goals
- Responsiveness, since my initial redesign was static and would not be well-received by mobile users... and most young, new students would likely see the site on their phone first.
- SEO, actually using keywords like Portland and such to make sure Google indexes the site and brings us up if people search for kendo, martial arts, etc
- Good design in general, this is a change for me to work on color and typography a bit since this is a static site and won't be needed much if any JavaScript work

## Even crazier Goals
- Turn the result into a Jekyll template of sorts so that I can factor out common code like the header/footer into includes, and support ability for people to update pages with markdown or create blog entries.

## Todos
